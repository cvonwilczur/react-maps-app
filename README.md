# Eat at Melrose

This is the initial version of a neigborhood maps app built in React and utilizing third-party APIs. The project is part of the final React project and the capstone in the Udacity Front-End Web Developer nanodegree, encompassing knowledge on front-end frameworks, third-party APIs, responsive design, progressive web apps and accessibility.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need NPM to install the relevant files specified in the package.json.

```
For example, the package relies on running React and a React maps library.
```

### Installing and Running the App

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running:

Download the repo to your local machine

Navigate to the folder in terminal and run "npm install"

Once install is complete, the app requires you to be in production, so run "npm run build" to assemble a production version build.

Set up a simple server using the included package serve by running "serve -s build"
